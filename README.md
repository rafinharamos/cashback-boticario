## Documentation

You can find a postman collection for the API and do some tests at the root of the project (cashback_collections_api)

You can also have access to the complete system running on heroku at the address (https://cashback-boticario-app.herokuapp.com/)

You can have access to documentation in this address.

Note: *Note that the first request may take a while because it is a free service, so it goes to sleep mode when is not being used.*

## How to run - Docker (recommended)

To run this project over Docker container, everything you have to do is install Docker and 
run docker-compose (it comes with Docker by default). It will start automatically the API and PostgreSQL database, ready to use.

### Installation (docker)

To install Docker, visit [https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/) and follow the instructions related to your OS.

### Running (docker)

After install Docker, open your terminal/cmd, navigate to repository folder and execute the following command:

> docker-compose up --build

PS: even it's used only [Alpine images](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) to speed up the process, this command can take some minutes in the first time, 
since it will download postgres/python images and configure the whole environment. 
_So, it's perfect time to take a coffee_ ðŸ˜… 
 
This command will start two containers:
- `db_1` the PostgreSQL container for database usage 
- `web_1` the Python container running Django application
